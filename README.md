The overall purpose of this workflow is to clean and wrangle control program data from GBRMPA so that it takes a standardised form to be utilised in research. 

The four major steps in this process are as follows: 
- Acquire control data
- Convert data to standard legacy format 
- Assign nearest site to manta tow data
- Perform required mathematical operation
